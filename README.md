# Software Engineering for Machine Learning Assignment

### Project Context

You are in the process of developing a ‘new’ system that will improve the CMU graduate student admission process. During this development effort your team has identified several key areas where machine learning could improve the product. Specifically, there is a very large population of applicants as is the size of packets submitted. Historically, the down select effort has required significant manual analysis. Because CMU has collected student performance data your team can use this information to help predict which applicants will have the highest likelihood of success.

### Tasks

You and your team have been given the historical dataset and need to explore it in order to understand what information is available. You will use the sci-kit learn python package to build and train a model once you have sufficient understanding of the dataset. After your model is built you need to evaluate the model quality. Once you determine the model quality is sufficient your team needs to build a microservice that takes as input a student’s information and then returns some likelihood of success. This service needs to be incorporated into your existing admissions product.
